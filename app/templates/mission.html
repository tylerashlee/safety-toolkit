  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6;">
    Cybersecurity is crucial to protecting our information and devices from unauthorized access and abuse. As our lives become increasingly interwoven into the digital space, threats to our internet security are also on the rise. Reports from the Human Rights Research Center and the United Nations show that women and people of color are disproportionately impacted by technology-facilitated abuse.

  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 1rem;">
    Despite these alarming statistics, many women still arenâ€™t aware of how to adequately protect themselves online. This page was created to give them the confidence to make informed decisions about their digital security.
