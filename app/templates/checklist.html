    <h1>Cybersecurity Safety Checklist 🔐</h1>
    <p>Use this checklist to ensure you're staying secure every day:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>🔑 Change your passwords immediately if there is a breach.</li>
      <li>📲 Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) wherever possible. This makes it harder for hackers to gain unauthorized access, even if they have your password.</li>
      <li>💻 Keep your operating system and apps up to date. Updates patch critical security holes that hackers exploit!</li>
      <li>🛡️ Only share personal info on trusted, secure websites. Check for typos in the URL and look for the HTTPS or padlock symbol to know if it's secure.</li>
      <li>🔒 Use strong, unique passwords for each account. This ensures that if one password is breached, your other accounts remain secure!</li>
      <li>🛡️ Regularly back up your important data to the cloud and external drives.</li>
      <li>🕵️ Be cautious about phishing attempts and scam emails. To learn more about how to spot phishing you can visit
